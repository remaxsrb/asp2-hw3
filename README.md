Purpose of this assignment was to get familiar with how hash tables work and to get an idea how they might be used in real life projects,
My work here was to load and parse a movie 'database' from a .csv file and to create hash values of movies based on their names and insert them into hash table.
I had to implement various functionalities such as insertion and deletion from a hash table, searching the table etc.
